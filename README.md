# Windows_Service_to_do_some_file_manipulation
Studied manipulation of files in Windows service

Installation: Simply download and extract a ZIP-file from a password protected web server to a designated directory, and place a shortcut in shell:startup for a given exe-file. No other installation steps necessary. 

 

Updating: Just like installation, except check if the program is already running and ask it to stop. Then clean the program directory and perform the same steps as for Installation above.  

 

Removal: Check if program is running, ask to terminate, and remove the directory and startup-shortcut.
